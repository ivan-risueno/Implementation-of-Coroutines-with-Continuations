# Implementation-of-Coroutines-with-Continuations
Implementation of Coroutines with the use of the control structure known as continuations. This project is made by Iván Risueño and Adam Lázaro, for the course "Conceptes Avançats de Programació" at the "Grau en Enginyeria Informàtica" offered by the UPC.

The source code contains 3 test cases:
  - PingPong.js: Executes an instance of a table tennis match, in which the two players and the announcer are coroutines.
  - SameFringe.js: This is the solution of the Same Fringe problem.
  - TestFibonacci.js: Computes the Fibonacci sequence until the desired value (global variable n in the source code).
  
This implementation is coded in Javascript using a modified version of Rhino 1.7.15, which solves a problem related to continuations.
